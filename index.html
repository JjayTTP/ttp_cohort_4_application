                        I am Daraus Zhang, a junior at John Jay College studying computer science. 
                        I enjoy coding and have been tinkering with computers since middle school.
                        I am proficient with C++ and have some experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and R. 
                        I work part-time at a sushi place and lead our school's Valorant team.
                        In my free time I enjoy listening to music and hanging out with friends. 
                        Here are my jobs below:

                                On the weekends, I help out at a sushi place in Long Island. 
                                I do a lot of prep work and make sushi rolls or help out in the kitchen. 
                                I also restock food and clean up at the end of the shift. <br><br><br>

                                I lead our school's Valorant team. We have a tournament every semester with a game each Tuesday and practice sessions on Thursdays.

                            Coding is something I have a lot of fun with. 
                            Many times, there are things that don't work or things that I don't know. 
                            When that happens, it allows me to use my problem solving skills and it feels great when I fix it.
                            Here are some of the languages that I know:<br><br>
                            C++, Python, HTML, CSS, R
